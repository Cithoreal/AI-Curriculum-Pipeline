So, in particular, there is no need to escape ampersands and angle brackets, nor is there employment of the CDATA mechanism.  But the real value is that there is just one version to edit, and any changes will be reflected in both copies.  We demonstrate this in the sample book, since it has the xinclude mechanism in place.

We have created the pre-defined  macro \\amp as one way specify these, but the escape sequence &amp; may be used also.  The second, fourth, sixth,  ampersands separate columns, and the spacing between columns will be provided automatically.  The first, third, fifth,  ampersands are alignment points for the equations in each column.  Typically this is placed just prior to a binary operator, such as an equal sign (\\amp = ), or for a column of explanations or commentary, just prior to the \\text{} macro.  Note that this scenario suggests always having an odd number of ampersands in each mrow.  In the example below, alignment is on the equals sign in the first two columns, and provides left-justification to the explanations in the third column.  N.B.: the use below of the \\text{} macro does not include mathematics within its argument.  Doing so may yield unpredictable results depending on your choice of delimiters for the mathematics (and using an m tag will be ineffective).\n                    \\frac{dx}{dt} \\amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \\amp \\frac{dy}{dt} \\amp = x^3 - y          \\amp\\amp x, y\\text{ version}\n                    \\frac{dw}{dt} \\amp = z^3 - w          \\amp \\frac{dz}{dt} \\amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \\amp\\amp z, w\\text{ version}\n                ",

It is very similar to align but adds no space between the equation columns.  So you can leave it that way, or you can add your own extra space to suit.  Here is a previous example with no inter-column space:\n                    \\frac{dx}{dt} \\amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \\amp \\frac{dy}{dt} \\amp = x^3 - y          \\amp\\amp x, y\\text{ version}\n                    \\frac{dw}{dt} \\amp = z^3 - w          \\amp \\frac{dz}{dt} \\amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \\amp\\amp z, w\\text{ version}\n                .  This modified example has a middle row with three columns, while the other rows have just one column, as a test of our routines for determining the mrow with the greatest number of ampersands (and how many there are),\n                    \\frac{dw}{dt} &= z^3 - w\n                    \\frac{dx}{dt} &= x^2 - 4x - y + 4 & \\frac{dy}{dt} &= x^3 - y&& x, y\\text{ third column}\n                    \\frac{dw}{dt} & = z^3 - w\n                .  Final example demonstrates that ampersands in other objects (matrices here) can wreak havoc with computing the number of columns.  So we provide yet another attribute to override automatic detection, alignat-columns.  This is the number of columns not the number of ampersands.  Generally, for c columns, there will be 2c-1 ampersands.\n                    A &= \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4\\end{bmatrix}\n                    &\n                    I &= \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n                .  One caveat: if your number of ampersands is even (see advice above about using an odd number) behavior should still be correct, as in next example.",

If the column has a non-paragraph cell with contents that are wider than the paragraph cells, results will be undesirable. There is presently no implementation for a paragraph cell that has a colspan greater than 1, although cells with colspan greater than 1 that are above or below a paragraph cell will behave. Setting width on a col that has no paragraph cells may produce unexpected results. A valign for the parent row (or the ambient tabular) can control vertical alignment (top, middle, or bottom). A paragraph cell's halign attribute (left, center, right, or justify) controls how the text is justfied. Cells inherit halign from row, col, and tabular in that order of preference.

In order to test the use of a percent sign (%) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, 58, which is a way to represent the character X in a URL.  The first column's entries are forced to be wrapped in a \\multicolumn by specifying their horizontal alignment.  The second column's entries will not be wrapped in a \\multicolumn.  So the two columns will look identical, other than the first having a left alignment, and the second has the default center alignment.  (This table is known to render poorly in a Jupyter notebook.

We illustrate a way to get a three.js image out of an HTML page as a Javascript file and render it on a  slate.  We follow the second method in a blog post from the n-Category Cafe.\n                    Open a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes a Sage kernel.  This can be done easily at CoCalc (and for free initially).\n\n                    Sketch a surface using Sage code.  We recycle the suggestion from Juan Carlos Bustamante in :\n                        var('x,y')\n                        plot3d(x^2 - y^2, (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1), color=\"orange\", mesh=true)\n                    \n\n                    Look for a button (in the lower-right) which will provide a menu option Save as HTML.  Save the resulting HTML file, and open a copy in a text editor.\n\n                    \n                        You are now looking for two HTML script elements.  One will tell you just which version of three.js is being used, vis a @src attribute.  For the second example below we located\n                            https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sagemath/threejs-sage@r122/build/three.min.js\n                        The @r122 will likely be a version number, which is a good thing for the longevity of your work.  This will get used in the source attribute of your interactive, which will have platform set to javascript.\n\n                        The second script element is likely huge and has many generic functions defined it.  There may be a huge variable full of data points computed by Sage.  Copy the contents of this script element into a new Javascript file (so use a .js extension).  Do not edit in any way until you read further.  Once adjusted, this file too gets specified in the source attribute of your interactive.\n                    \n\n                    Your interactive needs a slate element for the graphic to draw on, and you will need to give it a proper xml:id attribute, plus teh surface will be set to div.  Then you need to edit the Javascript file to connect the graphic with the slate, via IDs in your  source and on teh HTML div created by the slate.  Look at the provided examples to see how.  Do not make any other edits to this file, even if tempted.\n\n                    Study the two examples below, and mimic how they were constructed.\n                ",

The first member of the list is a prime and is saved/recorded.  Then all multiples of that prime (which not a prime, excepting the prime itself!) are removed from the list.

But since this version is a duplicate, the knowl for the solution is a file version, not an embedded version, and hence free from duplicating any unique identifaction like an HTML id.  So we test its styling and function here: \n                A cross-reference to a poem, where we need to use a title for the link text, since a poem is not numbered: \n                A cross-reference to a references division in a subsection, which should not be numbered where born, but which has the number of its parent division in a cross-reference: .

Since the default for margins is automatic, the remaining 20% of the overall width will be used for three inter-panel spaces of 5% and two margins of 2.5% each.  Note the numbering of these as independent figures.  We have left the captions empty for reasons of space, but you could add more information.  Note that in print, a page break is allowed between any two of the sidebyside and cannot be suppressed.",
